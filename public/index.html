    <h1>What's an Internet?</h1>
    <p>The internet used to be balls awful. It was mostly just a black background with an ugly font on top. Then tables showed up and people could read newspapers on their computers and everyone lost their tits. Later on, over the course of about a week someone created javascript and pop-ups were born. Eventually, something as pure and noble as the Pop-up was corrupted by marketers who wanted to sell stuff.</p>

	  <p>Flash eventually popped up and once again, peoples tits were blown off. Websites could make cool animations that visitors would be forced to watch prior to entering the site. Additionally, Flash allowed developers to use a whole bunch of different shapes. However, Flash too was corrupted by unoriginal marketers who wanted to make really annoying ads to try and sell you a new smiley face set. </P>
